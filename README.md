- How to run: Instructions for reproducing your pipeline
- Outreach style: Annotated screenshots, peer learning notes



This repository documents my practical exploration of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows using Python and SQL. As a mechanical engineering student pivoting into software/data engineering, I’ve built these pipelines to deepen my understanding of data infrastructure, transformation logic, and workflow optimization.
Whether you're a fellow learner, a recruiter, or a collaborator, this repo offers annotated notebooks, modular scripts, and real-world reflections on building resilient, readable data pipelines.


Why ETL and ELT?
- ETL: Ideal for structured transformation before loading into a data warehouse.
- ELT: Suited for modern cloud architectures where transformation happens post-load.
- I explored both to understand their trade-offs, tooling, and infrastructure implications — especially in the context of smart data centers and scalable engineering workflows


Tools & Technologies
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy
- Editors: VS Code, DBeaver, Geany
- Version Control: Git & GitHub (with clean branching and commit hygiene)
- Workflow Style: Modular scripts, annotated notebooks, markdown documentatio



What You'll Find
-  Clean, reproducible ETL and ELT pipelines
-  Missing value handling and schema validation
-  Transformation logic using SQL (CTEs, window functions)
-  Annotated screenshots and markdown cells for peer learning
-  Reflections on pipeline design, error recovery, and infrastructure relevanc


Outreach & Learning Style
I believe in transparent learning and collaborative growth. This repo is part of my public portfolio — designed to support peer learning, scholarship applications, and global collaboration. Feel free to fork, adapt, or reach out with feedback.
